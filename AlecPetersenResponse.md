Heeyyoo! The idea is very cool, and realistically seems like something a lot of people would be interested in.
On the business and legal side, I don't know a whole lot about business or legal things. However, if we wanted

front-end as far as the class project goes simply so we can focus on properly designing the back end with an eye
towards future features.
