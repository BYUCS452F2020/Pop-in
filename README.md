I have a lot of ideas for this mobile app which wouldn't fit in the scope of this class, so I will come up with a set of core features that will be finished. This app will require a lot of database tables as well which will fit the requirement. Our priorities will be nailing down a feature set that we can accomplish within the scope of this project.
