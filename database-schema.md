#### Thoughts

Do we want to store additional information about a friendship? Time as friends, parties attended together, etc.? We can put that info somewhere else and produce it by querying other tables, but it's something to think about. If we want to tie that information specifically to a friendship (thinking about it, probably donâ€™t, but we can talk about it), we might want a new primary key for that.
